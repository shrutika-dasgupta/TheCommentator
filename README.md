User Interface Design Decisions:
----------------------------------

1) I have mainly kept the design to be simple.
2) I have divided my main page into two vertical divs :  so that any inputs entered by the user to search can be visible along side the results.
3) I have tried using many UI elements to enable better user accessibility.
4) Proper feedback system is provided if the user provides any invalid inputs.
